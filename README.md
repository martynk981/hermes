## Tech details

Storage: PostgresDB

APP framework: NestJs

Language: NodeJS+TypeScript

DB structure: [init.sql](db/01-init.sh)

Notes:

* After analyzing the content of the data samples, I figured out that the articles ids are already set and are not autogenerated. That is why in the articles table id's are just primary keys, but in products table - suquence.


Application consists of two modules:
 * [data-loader](src/data-loader): to upload the data from files 
 * [shop](src/shop): to review and to sell the products

## TODO
* impove open api schemas
* add validation for the uploading files
* add validation to the input params when selleing the product
* add unit tests (currently there are only e2e tests)
